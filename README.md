# patternRecogEE240

Here are some of the cooler assignements that I had in my graduate Pattern Recognition class at UCR in the Spring of 2021. 

They're fairly basic and should be commented so as not to need the source assignment. 

This is a private repo to show off some of the stuff I made, but won't show up in a google search for one of Dr. Asif's future students.
